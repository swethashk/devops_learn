#  Kubernetes Manifest Files

Kubernetes manifest files are YAML (or JSON) configuration files used to define the **desired state** of objects in a Kubernetes clusterâ€”such as pods, deployments, services, and more.

These files tell Kubernetes **what resources to create and manage**, and **how** they should behave.

## Common Kubernetes Resource Types

| Resource     | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Pod`        | Defines a single or multiple containers |
| `Deployment` | Manages pod replicas and rolling updates |
| `Service`    | Exposes applications via networking |
| `ConfigMap`  | Stores non-sensitive configuration data |
| `Secret`     | Stores sensitive data like passwords and tokens |
| `Ingress`    | Manages external HTTP/S access |
| `Namespace`  | Provides logical separation of resources |
