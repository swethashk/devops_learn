3. Dockerize a Simple App and Deploy on Kubernetes (Minikube or Cloud)
4. Configure Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Build a Jenkins Pipeline for Multi-Stage Deployment
Goal: Automate build, test, and deployment of a sample app.

Steps:

Install Jenkins

Set up Jenkins on your local machine, VM, or use a cloud Jenkins service.

Create a Sample App

Use a simple app like a Node.js or Python “Hello World” REST API.

Push Code to GitHub

Initialize git repo, commit your code, and push to GitHub.

Create Jenkins Pipeline Job

In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and connect it to your GitHub repo.

Write Jenkinsfile

Define pipeline stages:

Checkout code

Build (e.g., npm install)

Test (e.g., unit tests)

Deploy (e.g., deploy to test server or Kubernetes)

Run Pipeline and Troubleshoot

Trigger pipeline manually or via GitHub webhook, monitor logs, and fix issues.

2. Automate Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform
Goal: Use Terraform to provision infrastructure on AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Steps:

Install Terraform

Download and install Terraform CLI from terraform.io.

Configure Cloud Credentials

Set up access keys for your cloud provider.

Write Terraform Configuration Files

Define resources like virtual machines, networks, or storage buckets in .tf files.

Initialize Terraform

Run terraform init in your project directory to initialize.

Plan the Infrastructure

Run terraform plan to see what Terraform will create.

Apply the Configuration

Run terraform apply to provision resources.

Verify in Cloud Console

Check your cloud provider’s console to confirm resource creation.

Destroy Resources

When done, run terraform destroy to clean up.

3. Dockerize a Simple App and Deploy on Kubernetes
Goal: Containerize an app and deploy it on Kubernetes.

Steps:

Write a Simple App

Use Node.js, Python Flask, or any simple REST API app.

Create a Dockerfile

Define base image, copy code, install dependencies, and specify startup command.

Build Docker Image

Run docker build -t myapp:latest .

Run Locally

Test the image with docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest

Install Minikube

Set up Minikube for local Kubernetes cluster.

Create Kubernetes Deployment YAML

Define Deployment and Service resources to run your container.

Deploy to Kubernetes

Use kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Verify Deployment

Check pods with kubectl get pods and services with kubectl get svc.

Access App

Use minikube service <service-name> to open app in browser.

4. Configure Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Goal: Set up metrics scraping and dashboards.

Steps:

Install Prometheus

Use Helm or manually deploy Prometheus on Kubernetes or local machine.

Configure Prometheus

Edit prometheus.yml to add scrape targets (your app or node exporters).

Run Node Exporter (Optional)

Collect system metrics from your host or cluster nodes.

Install Grafana

Deploy Grafana on Kubernetes or local machine.

Add Prometheus as Data Source in Grafana

Import/Create Dashboards

Use built-in dashboards or build custom ones to visualize metrics.

Set Alerts (Optional)

Configure alert rules in Prometheus and integrate with notification channels.
